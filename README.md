# Virtual Companion

An application meant to strengthen the relationship between teachers , parents and students in high schools around Romania, built with React-Native and Firebase.  

Features:

- At the moment, students are still being sent incorrect grade sheets which might affect their application to universities, by centralizing all grades given by teachers , we would be able to generate them , thus reducing human error.
